  // Professional Summary
  summary: `I am an aspiring AI engineer who enjoys connecting the dots. I connect ideas from different fields, people from different teams, and applications from different industries. I have strong technical skills and an academic background in computer science, machine learning, and prompt engineering.

I like solving business problems with AI solutions and algorithms. I explain complex ideas to non-technical people. I can work across different industries to deliver high-performing AI solutions.

As a Conversational AI Engineer, I designed systems that handled over 1000 queries daily with 95% user satisfaction. I developed a system that processed 200+ incidents weekly with 78% automation. I also built an AI market research platform that generated over 3,700 words in professional reports in under 5 seconds using advanced multi-agent prompt work.

One of my best projects was developing a real-time American Sign Language detection system with 92% accuracy, showing my skills in multi-modal prompt engineering and commitment to making technology accessible for everyone.`,
